### Bugs

Here we will outline all known bugs and potential causes:

* Trying to send a template before a property is created causes a crash
* Map doesn't load properly
* "Forgot my password" doesn't work since Devise isn't set up to send emails currently
* Searching properties doesn't work
* Sometimes modals don't populate and the page has to be refreshed
* In the new address modal, clicking new community takes the user to a separate page and deletes all current progress
* In the separate new community page described above, hitting the back button doesn't take the user back home
* New lines in the template editor don't translate to the email (all text is just on 1 line)
