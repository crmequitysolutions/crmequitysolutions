###Overview

The frontend of the application follows the generic Ruby on Rails project structure. All HTML files are located in /app/views. Each distinct view has a folder with a name corresponding to the name of the controller for that view. The javascript/coffeescript files associated with each view are located in /app/assets/javascript.

######Strucutre: The outline of the home page consists of a **navbar** on top, and a **container** directly under that encloses all the other componenets.
Within this larger container, there are two columns. One holds the Tables Panel and Links Panel, and the other holds the Tables. On desktop, these columns are separated horizontally. On mobile, the columns stretch out to the width of the screen and become separated vertically.
