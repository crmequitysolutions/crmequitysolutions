### Purpose

CRM Equity Solutions is an organizational and task mana*ent tool designed to help wholesale property buyers document property information and easily send information to investors and homeowners. Right now, these wholesale buyers are wasting hours and hours of work hand-copying data into disorganized Excel spreadsheets and editing hundreds of postcards individually by hand. With our tool, the property data will automatically be added to a database, the user will be notified if specific property data fits criteria established by an investor, and it will quickly and easily create emails and postcards to send to the investors and homeowners.

Our software is made for real estate wholesalers and investors. CRM is valuable to our users because it saves them time. One of the most essential factors to successful wholesaling is the ability to quickly reach out to potential investors. This can be time consuming due to the lack of automation tools. For instance, the wholesaler needs to manually match homes to potential investor based on some criteria defined by that investor. Then the wholesaler needs to contact each investor one by one, usually by email. Our software will automate time consuming tasks like these and help wholesalers sell homes more quickly.

This project will create an app to be used by wholesalers for a variety of purposes. First, they will be able to store data (e.g., address, # of rooms, surrounding area info) and pictures of the property in the appâ€™s database. They will also be linked to other sites such as Google Maps that could provide additional information about the property. Second, they will be able to create templates for brochures, postcards, and forms that can then also be filled out by the app to save time from filling them out by hand. Then, it will also be able to keep track of the replies and responses to said postcards and brochures.
